/*
Problem statement: Determine if a cycle exists in the given list of nodes
*/

/*
Solution 1: Marking nodes
One way of solving this problem will be marking the nodes as we visit them.
If a node is marked and visit the same node, we can conclude that a cycle
exists in the list. But this will require us to change the existing value.
We mark the value as the negation of the existing value. For example we have
three nodes

			1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5
                             /|\	|
                              -------

As we visit the first node we change it to -1, then we move to the next node.
If there is a cycle we will definitely visit the marked nodes. If not the loop
traversing the nodes will terminate. We need to undo the negations before
returning the function.

Time Complexity: O(n)	Space Complexity: O(1)
Note: This method will only work if all the values in the list are either positive/negative.

/*
Solution 2: Using Floyd's algorithm
Here you use 2 pointers, 1 moving at the speed of 1 and the other moving at the speed of 2.
Finally the 2 pointers would meet each other if there is a cycle or the fast pointer would
encounter null if itâ€™s not a cycle.
